# Task (story-track)

StoryTrack Web Application for Task and Story Management with Quasar, Vue 3, and the Retool API

StoryTrack is a Kanban-style task management web application developed with the Quasar Framework and Vue.js 3. It is designed to facilitate the efficient visualization and management of stories or tasks within projects. The application integrates two APIs: one simulated using Retool to manage user registration and another for real-world project tracking, offering a production-like experience. The project focuses on a clean and scalable architecture, along with an adaptable user interface, ensuring a smooth experience across all types of devices. It also follows modular development practices for easy maintenance and expansion.

Features

    ‚úÖUser authentication via API (plaintext credentials):

    Simple login system that uses plaintext username and password for authentication.
    The Retool API stores user credentials in plain text (not recommended for production environments, but suitable for testing).
    Users can register and log in directly through the API by providing their username and password.
    Authentication is handled by verifying the provided credentials against values ‚Äã‚Äãstored in the Retool database.

    üìã Task Management (Kanban Style):

    Retrieves task data from the Retool API that represents project tasks or stories.
    Displays tasks on a board organized by status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Completed).
    Task cards display key information: title, status, due date, assignee, and priority.

    üîç Drill-down View and Filtering:

    View details of individual tasks.
    Filter tasks by assigned user, status, or priority using URL parameters or local filters.

    ‚öôÔ∏è State Management:

    Centralized state management with Pinia, which stores user information, session state, and task data.

    üé® Responsive Design:

    Fully responsive design with Quasar components.
    Mobile-optimized interface with layouts adapted to different screen sizes.

üõ† Technologies Used:

    Quasar Framework: For modern, responsive UI components and designs.
    Vue 3: JavaScript framework for reactive logic and application structure.
    Pinia: For centralized state management.
    Retool API: Mock API for retrieving task and project story data.
    Vite: Frontend development tool for rapid development.

## Retool API Base URLs for Fake Data

These environment variables are used to securely store the base URLs for your Retool APIs.

There are two variables defined in the .env file, which are used to configure your project without hardcoding sensitive information. These are for fake data APIs, making them suitable for testing and development purposes.
